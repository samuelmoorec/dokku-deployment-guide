# Dokku environment variables
This guide is for setting environment variables specific to your application. This guide will be helpful for setting variables that our `application.properties` would normally handle.


### ~Important Note~

Do not add ***any*** of the following from your `application.properties` to your Dokku server environment variables:

* `spring.datasource.url`
* `spring.datasource.username`
* `spring.datasource.password`

Those are perfect for telling our *local machine* where our database is and how to access it as an admin, but that information is not relevant or valid for the database on our server.


## What are environment variables?
Before we can get started on adding environment variables to our application we first need to know what they are. Ultimately environment variables are just variables that you set in your system. These can often be used to make your life easier or hold important system info. A good example of this is if we needed to change our current directory to our home directory we could just use the command `cd $HOME` and we would be taken to our home directory. You can find more on environment variables [here](https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa#:~:text=An%20environment%20variable%20is%20a,at%20a%20point%20in%20time.)
## SpringBoot environment variables
Typically, in a spring boot project we will have a file in the resources' directory called `application.properties`. Spring boot makes our lives easier by letting our application use this file as our project's environment variables when the file is present, but when we deploy our application does not have a `application.properties` because it is in our git ignore file. This means that we will have to set the environment variables in the remote server. When we set these variables on our server there is a strict naming convention that we must follow which can be found [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding-from-environment-variables). Essentially all we have to do is Uppercase the entirety of the variable name. Replace all `.` with `_` and entirely delete any dash characters `-`. We can find an example of how this would look down below. The value of the variable will stay the same as it is in the `application.properties`.
```
application.properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

--------- converts to ---------

enviroment variable
SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDLAUTO=update
```
If we are using an api key in our `application.properties` with our own naming convention it is not required to change the variable name unless it contains any `.`. The period character is considered numeric, so we are not able to put this in an environment variable name.
## Adding environment variables in dokku
To add an environment variable to our application in dokku we just have to use the following command from our server
```
config:set <app> <enviroment_variable_and_value>
```
Here is an example of how we would add an environment variable to our spring_blog application.
```
#Example

dokku config:set spring_blog SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDLAUTO=update
```
## Adding multiple variables at once
If we needed to add multiple variables to our application and don't want to add them one at a time we can also use the `config:set` command to set multiple environment variables  at once. To add multiple environment variables at once use the following command from the server.
```
config:set <app> <first_enviroment_variable> <second_enviroment_variable> ect...
```
Here is an example of how we would add multiple environment variables to our spring_blog application.
```
#Example

dokku config:set spring_blog filestack_api_key=aue392hljH3jl3ka SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDLAUTO=update
```
